# EvaluationFingerprintSystem

This project aims to evaluate the performance of two biometric systems both in a verification and
identification setting. Two systems are considered: the fingerprint for the left and the one for the right index. To
evaluate these systems, the actual predicted fingerprint similarity scores are used; it allows to bypass all steps
of preprocessing, feature extraction and matching so as to concentrate only on the score evaluation. 

The data (biometrics scores set BSSR1) came from the American National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST).
